They are used to describe the basic features of the data under consideration. They provide simple summary measures which give an overview of the dataset. Summary measures that are commonly used to describe a data set are measures of central tendency and measures of variability or dispersion.\n","\n","**Measures of central tendency** include the `mean`, `median` and `mode`. These measures summarize a given data set by providing a single data point. These measures describe the center position of a distribution for a data set. We analyze the frequency of each data point in the distribution and describes it using the mean, median or mode. They provide the average of a data set. They can be either a representation of entire population or a sample of the population.\n","\n","**Measures of variability or dispersion** include the `variance` or `standard deviation`, `coefficient of variation`, `minimum` and `maximum` values, `IQR` (Interquartile Range), `skewness` and `kurtosis`. These measures help us to analyze how spread-out the distribution is for a dataset. So, they provide the shape of the data set."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fa23bd70","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.005051,"end_time":"2023-10-16T10:13:37.753728","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-16T10:13:37.748677","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# 0.
